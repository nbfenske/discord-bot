# discord-bot
An implementation for a simple Discord bot

# main.py
This is the main "meat" of this bot. Using the Discord and Giphy APIs, I've enabled the following functions:
- fetching and returning a gif
- adding, deleting, and reading from a database
- sending a random message based on a keyword
- a help page

# keep_alive.py
This is just a small bit of code that keeps on getting pinged by a monitoring service. This way I can host the main code on the service Replit and have it run continuously without having to go through their paywall.
